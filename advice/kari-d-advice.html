                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something 
                    that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new 
                    opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so 
                    specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
                     direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem 
                     solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time 
                     for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to 
                    write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, 
                    you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code 
                    you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW 
                    exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, 
                    and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your 
                    learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to 
                    train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't 
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
                <h4>Perserverence is a MUST!</h4>
                <p>When the going gets tough, just remember that even the best had to start
                    somewhere! You are learning and everyday, you are better than you were 
                    the day before. A common struggle among new developers is imposter 
                    syndrome. It can be difficult when you feel like you are struggling and 
                    everyone else seems to know what the heck is going on.</p>
                <p> DON'T FALL FOR IT!</p>
                <p>Here's a little secret: everyone feels inferior at some time. You are not
                    alone. In fact, you are better than you think! And while it may never 
                    completely go away, as you gain skills and confidence, you will have less
                    and less days of feeling like an imposter, and more days being the 
                    rockstar developer that you are!
